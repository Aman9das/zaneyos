# ZaneyOS 🟰 Best ❄️ NixOS Configs

ZaneyOS is my production machines config files. To easily reproduce my system all you need to do is replace the hardware-configuration.nix file with the one in your /etc/nixos/ folder that was generated after install. **You will need to change the username and hostname in the files in the nixos folder!**
